RAG System Architecture

Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances 
large language models by grounding their responses in external knowledge.

Core Components
The system consists of several key components that work together:

1. Document Loader
The document loader handles parsing of various file formats including PDF 
and TXT files. It extracts text while preserving metadata like page numbers 
and source information.

2. Text Splitter
Documents are split into smaller chunks for efficient processing. The splitter 
uses intelligent separators to maintain semantic coherence across chunks.

3. Embeddings
Each chunk is converted into a vector representation using embedding models. 
These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text.

4. Vector Store
ChromaDB stores the embeddings and enables fast similarity search. When a 
question is asked, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks.

5. LLM Chain
The language model generates answers based on the retrieved context. This 
grounding reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy.

Benefits
RAG systems offer several advantages over pure language models:
- Reduced hallucinations through grounding
- Source attribution for transparency
- Easy updates without retraining
- Cost-effective scaling

Implementation
Our implementation uses LangChain for orchestration, OpenAI for embeddings 
and generation, ChromaDB for vector storage, and FastAPI for the backend API.

Conclusion
RAG represents a significant advancement in making AI systems more reliable 
and trustworthy for real-world applications.
